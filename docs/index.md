title: Orbital stability for known exoplanet systems
description: >-
  exostab estimates the orbital stability of known multi-planet systems with Hill spacing, the angular momentum
  deficit and N-body integrations with MEGNO, propagates the published uncertainties and shows every assumption.

## Three indicators, one conservative verdict

Stability cannot be proven for more than two planets, so exostab asks the question in three different ways and
reports all three answers side by side. When they disagree, it says so instead of picking the most comfortable
answer.

    ---

    The Gladman (1993) criterion for two planets, in its form for eccentric orbits, and for three or more the
    spacing heuristic of Chambers et al. (1996) with the eccentricity-dependent requirement of Pu & Wu (2015).

    Is there enough AMD for two orbits to cross? Laskar & Petit (2017), with the resonance-overlap and Hill
    refinements of Petit, Laskar & Boué (2017, 2018).

-   :material-chart-timeline-variant:{ .lg .middle } __N-body integration and MEGNO__

    ---

    Direct integration with REBOUND's WHFast, repeated with IAS15 as a check, and the MEGNO chaos indicator
    to tell regular from chaotic motion.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Methods](methods.md)

-   :material-robot-outline:{ .lg .middle } __SPOCK, optional__

    ---

    The machine-learned classifier of Tamayo et al. (2020) for systems of three or more planets, run in its own
    environment with `--spock`. It can make the verdict marginal, never unstable on its own.

## Built to be traced and reproduced

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-clipboard-text-search-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Every assumption shown__

    ---

    Gaps in the archive are filled by explicit rules. Every value carries its provenance, and every rule that
    fires is printed on the report card and stored in `report.json`.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Data and assumptions](data-assumptions.md)

-   :material-dice-multiple-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Uncertainties propagated__

    ---

    Seeded Monte Carlo draws within the published error bars. An indicator's verdict stands only if at least
    95% of the draws agree with the nominal one.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Methods](methods.md)

-   :material-shield-check-outline:{ .lg .middle } __A conservative verdict__

    ---

    *Stable* only if every indicator agrees and no N-body draw has a close encounter; *unstable* only if the
    integration shows close encounters or escapes for nearly all draws, and not when that rests on upper
    limits alone. Mixed evidence is reported as *marginal*, with the reason.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Methods](methods.md)

-   :material-replay:{ .lg .middle } __Reproducible__

    ---

    The same seed gives the same draws. `report.json` records the seed, the software versions, the integrator
    settings and the archive download date.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Validation](validation.md)

-   :material-check-decagram-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Validated__

    ---

    Energy conservation, the Hill limit, TRAPPIST-1, GJ 876, Kepler-11 and a reproduction of the HD 127195
    Research Note run nightly in continuous integration.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Validation](validation.md)

-   :material-console-line:{ .lg .middle } __Command line, web app, catalog__

    ---

    `exostab check` for one system and `exostab sweep` for "what if" scans, a Streamlit app with sliders, and a
    weekly catalog of every multi-planet system in the archive.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Catalog](catalog.md)

</div>

## Get started

=== "Command line"

    ```bash
    pip install "exostab @ git+https://github.com/mimitoz62/exostab@v1.0.0"
    exostab check "TRAPPIST-1"
    exostab list --min-planets 4 --max-period-days 200
    ```

    Python 3.10 or newer. The first `check` downloads the archive's multi-planet table once (about 2,700 rows)
    and caches it; `--offline` uses a bundled snapshot of 22 well-known systems. A package on PyPI is planned;
    until then, install from GitHub.

=== "Web app"

    ```bash
    pip install "exostab[web] @ git+https://github.com/mimitoz62/exostab@v1.0.0"
    python -m exostab.web
    ```

    Then open <http://localhost:8501>. Search a system, edit its parameters, try "what if" changes with
    sliders, choose a time budget, and download the report or a shareable link to the run. The app runs on your
    own computer; there is no hosted version yet. More in [Web app](web.md).

=== "Your own parameters"

    ```bash
    exostab check --from-file examples/two_planet.yaml
    exostab sweep "HD 127195" --planet b --param e --range 0 0.6 --steps 25
    ```

    A YAML file describes a system the archive does not have, or a published solution you want to test; the
    repository's `examples/` folder has two to start from. `sweep` varies one parameter of one planet and records
    every indicator.

## What a check gives you

A report card in the terminal, like the one in the recording above, and three files: `report.json`, `orbits.png`
and `megno.png`. The excerpt below is from `exostab check "TRAPPIST-1" --offline` (bundled archive snapshot of
2026-09-28, default settings).

## How it works

<div class="exo-steps" markdown>

<div class="exo-step" markdown>
__Fetch__

The NASA Exoplanet Archive's composite table (`pscomppars`), downloaded once and cached; a bundled snapshot of
22 systems offline; or your own YAML file.
</div>

<div class="exo-step" markdown>
__Complete__

Explicit rules fill the gaps. Each value is tagged measured, derived, assumed, estimated, randomized or upper
limit, and each rule adds a flag.
</div>

<div class="exo-step" markdown>
__Sample and integrate__

The nominal parameters and seeded Monte Carlo draws go through the Hill, AMD and N-body indicators, in
parallel worker processes.
</div>

<div class="exo-step" markdown>
__Report__

A conservative overall verdict, the report card, `report.json`, `orbits.png` and `megno.png`.
</div>

</div>

## What the verdicts mean

<div class="exo-verdicts" markdown>

<div class="exo-verdict exo-verdict--stable" markdown>
:material-check-circle-outline: __stable__
{ .exo-verdict__name }

The indicator's condition for stability holds for the nominal parameters and for at least 95% of the draws.
</div>

<div class="exo-verdict exo-verdict--marginal" markdown>
:material-scale-unbalanced: __marginal__
{ .exo-verdict__name }

Borderline, or the draws within the uncertainties disagree with the nominal parameters.
</div>

<div class="exo-verdict exo-verdict--unstable" markdown>
:material-close-circle-outline: __unstable__
{ .exo-verdict__name }

The indicator predicts instability for the nominal parameters and for at least 95% of the draws.
</div>

<div class="exo-verdict exo-verdict--inconclusive" markdown>
:material-help-circle-outline: __inconclusive__
{ .exo-verdict__name }

The indicator could not be evaluated reliably, for example because the integration's energy error was too
large.
</div>

</div>

The Hill and AMD criteria are *sufficient* conditions: failing them means stability is not guaranteed, not that
the system falls apart. With the published four-planet solution of Rivera et al. (2010), GJ 876 is unstable by
Hill spacing and marginal by AMD, yet every N-body draw is regular, because its planets are locked in a resonance.

continuous integration.

## Know the limits

!!! note "What a verdict does not tell you"

    - **Finite horizon.** The default run is 10,000 orbits of the innermost planet (41.4 years for TRAPPIST-1,
      14,634 years for HD 127195). "No chaos detected" over that span is not proof of stability over billions
      of years.
    - **Coplanar orbits.** Mutual inclinations are almost never measured, so all orbits are placed in one plane.
    - **Independent draws.** Parameters are drawn independently from their error bars, ignoring the
      correlations in the published posteriors.
    - **Not modelled.** Tides, general relativity, stellar evolution and companion stars. Circumbinary systems
      are rejected.

    The [methods](methods.md) and the [FAQ](faq.md) explain each choice.
