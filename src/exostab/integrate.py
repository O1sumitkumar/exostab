"""Direct N-body integrations with REBOUND.

Set-up (justified choices; see also DECISIONS.md):

* Units are set explicitly to (yr, AU, Msun) before any particle is added.
* Planets are added by orbital period in Jacobi coordinates (REBOUND's default when no primary is
  given), all in one plane (inclination 0): exostab models systems as coplanar because published
  sky-plane inclinations do not determine the mutual inclinations.
* WHFast (Rein & Tamayo 2015), a symplectic Wisdom-Holman integrator, is used for all runs. Its
  timestep is ``dt_fraction`` (default 1/30) of the shortest *pericentre passage timescale*
  T_p = 2 pi / f_dot_p = P (1 - e)^(3/2) / (1 + e)^(1/2) over all planets, where f_dot_p is the rate
  of change of the true anomaly at pericentre. Wisdom (2015) found 1/20 of T_p typically adequate to
  resolve the pericentre passage (as restated by Hadden & Lithwick 2018, who used 1/30). For circular
  orbits our step is P_min / 30, finer than the P_min / 20 required by the project brief and the same
  as the HD 127195 Research Note; for eccentric orbits it shrinks accordingly.
* IAS15 (Rein & Spiegel 2015), an adaptive high-order integrator, repeats the nominal run as an
  independent check; it does not rely on a fixed timestep and handles close approaches accurately.
* MEGNO (Cincotta & Simo 2000) is computed from REBOUND's variational equations (Rein & Tamayo 2016).
* A run stops early with a *close encounter* when two planets come closer than the mean of their Hill
  radii, (R_H,j + R_H,k) / 2 with R_H,k = a_k (m_k / 3 M_*)^(1/3). This uses REBOUND's collision detection
  ("line" mode, which also catches passages between two steps) with each planet given a radius of half its
  Hill radius. For two similar planets this equals the HD 127195 Research Note's rule (the smaller Hill
  radius); unlike a single global distance, it also works when the system contains a much smaller planet
  (DECISIONS.md, D20). The run stops with an *escape* when a
  body moves farther than ``escape_factor`` (default 100) times the largest semi-major axis from the
  centre of mass.
* REBOUND's collision search also pairs each planet with the star (radius 0), so it reports a planet that
  comes closer to the star than half its own Hill radius: a pericentre a (1 - e) < 0.5 a (m / 3 M_*)^(1/3),
  i.e. e above about 0.965 for one Jupiter mass and 0.925 for ten around a Sun-like star, from the start or
  after the eccentricity has grown. That is not a close encounter between planets, so it does not stop the
  run; a run that reaches its end is labelled ``star_approach`` instead of ``completed``. exostab models
  neither tides, nor general relativity, nor the size of the star, which can all matter that close, so such
  a run gets no verdict (:mod:`exostab.indicators.megno`). The distance is not a physical limit (stellar and
  planetary radii are not part of the model); it is where the collision search fires (DECISIONS.md, D20).
* The relative energy error |E(t) - E(0)| / |E(0)| is measured at ``ENERGY_CHECKS`` equally spaced times in
  every run (the nominal run, every Monte Carlo draw, the IAS15 check, catalog and sweep runs alike) and when a
  run stops early; the maximum is reported. The time series kept for the plots (``n_samples``) is a subset of
  these checks, so it cannot change the result. WHFast's error oscillates and peaks at pericentre passages, so
  the error at the end of a run alone can be orders of magnitude below this maximum. A run whose maximum
  exceeds the threshold in :mod:`exostab.indicators.megno` is classified as inconclusive instead of receiving
  a verdict.
