"""Angular momentum deficit (AMD) indicator.

The AMD of a planetary system (Laskar & Petit 2017, their Sect. 3) is

    C = sum_k Lambda_k (1 - sqrt(1 - e_k^2) cos i_k),   Lambda_k = m_k sqrt(G M_* a_k),

the difference between the angular momentum of circular, coplanar orbits and the actual one. It is
conserved by the secular (orbit-averaged) dynamics, so it bounds how eccentric the orbits can ever
become.

Unknown mutual inclinations (Laskar & Petit 2017, Sect. 6)
    exostab models coplanar systems, so it computes the coplanar AMD C_p (cos i_k = 1). Since cos i_k <= 1,
    the true AMD is C >= C_p for any mutual inclinations, and coefficients computed from C_p are lower
    bounds. For catalogue systems whose inclinations are unknown, Laskar & Petit (2017) "assume that the
    AMD contribution of mutual inclinations is equal to that of the eccentricities" (equipartition): "The
    total AMD is thus twice the measured AMD, and in this study we use beta = 2 beta_p", and "similarly we
    set beta_S = 2 beta_Sp". Petit, Laskar & Boué (2017, Sect. 5) "define the total AMD-stability
    coefficients as beta = 2 beta_p" for the resonance-overlap criterion as well. exostab follows them:
    beta, beta_S and beta_H below use C = 2 C_p, and the coplanar values beta_p = beta / 2 etc. are
    reported next to them. The factor 2 is a statistical assumption, not a bound: in Laskar & Petit's
    Table 1 the inclination AMD of the Solar System is 1.04 times the eccentricity AMD for the four inner
    planets but only 0.37 times for all eight.

AMD stability (Laskar & Petit 2017)
    A pair of adjacent planets (inner m, a; outer m', a'; alpha = a/a', gamma = m/m') is AMD-stable if
    the total AMD, even if absorbed entirely by this pair, cannot make the orbits cross:
    beta = C / (Lambda' C_c(alpha, gamma)) < 1, where the critical relative AMD C_c is the smallest AMD
    allowing a(1 + e) = a'(1 - e'). The critical inner eccentricity e_c solves

        alpha e + gamma e / sqrt(alpha (1 - e^2) + gamma^2 e^2) - 1 + alpha = 0,

    with e'_c = 1 - alpha - alpha e_c and C_c = gamma sqrt(alpha) (1 - sqrt(1 - e_c^2)) + 1 - sqrt(1 - e'_c^2)
    (their Eqs. for the collision line, the Lagrange condition and the relative AMD). The system is
    AMD-stable if every adjacent pair is; it is *strongly* AMD-stable if in addition the AMD cannot
    bring the innermost planet to the star, beta_S = C / Lambda_1 < 1.

Mean-motion-resonance overlap (Petit, Laskar & Boué 2017)
    Close pairs can become chaotic through overlapping first-order mean-motion resonances before their
    orbits cross. With eps = (m + m') / M_* and r = 0.80199, the overlap condition defines

        g(alpha, eps) = 3^4 (1 - alpha)^5 / (2^9 r eps) - 32 r eps / (9 (1 - alpha)^2)  (0 if alpha > alpha_cir),
        C_MMR = g^2 / 2 * gamma sqrt(alpha) / (1 + gamma sqrt(alpha)),

    where 1 - alpha_cir = 1.46 eps^(2/7) is the circular-orbit overlap limit. The critical AMD is C_c for
    alpha < alpha_R and C_MMR for alpha > alpha_R, alpha_R being the root of
    3^6 (1 - alpha)^7 - 3^2 2^9 r eps (1 - alpha)^3 - 2^14 (r eps)^2 = 0.

    Domain. C_MMR "was obtained thanks to the assumption that alpha was close to 1. Particularly, it
    makes no sense to talk about first-order MMR overlap for alpha<0.63 which corresponds to the center of
    the MMR 2:1. Therefore, the collision criterion should be used for small alpha" (Petit et al. 2017,
    Sect. 4.2). For their catalogue they "discard systems such that a pair of planets has
    eps > eps_lim = 8.20e-3", for which alpha_cir lies below the 2:1 resonance (Sect. 5.1). For
    eps > 3.1e-3, alpha_R is below 2^(-2/3) = 0.630, so the switching rule alone would apply C_MMR to
    pairs wide of the 2:1 resonance. exostab therefore uses C_MMR only for eps <= eps_lim and
    alpha > max(alpha_R, 2^(-2/3)), and C_c otherwise. A pair with eps > eps_lim, or with
    alpha_R < alpha <= 2^(-2/3), lies outside the domain in which either criterion was validated: its
    beta is computed with C_c and reported, but the system is never called AMD-stable (at most
    marginal). eps_lim = 8.11e-3 is the exact root of alpha_cir(eps) = 2^(-2/3); the paper's 8.20e-3
    follows from the rounded 1.46 and 0.63.

Hill stability in the AMD framework (Petit, Laskar & Boué 2018)
    For two planets (eps = (m + m') / M_*), the pair is Hill stable if its relative AMD C / Lambda' is below

        C_H = gamma sqrt(alpha) + 1 - (1 + gamma)^(3/2) sqrt(alpha / (gamma + alpha) (1 + 3^(4/3) eps^(2/3) gamma / (1 + gamma)^2)).

    The authors note that this criterion does not carry over to tightly packed systems of three or
    more planets, so it is only used for two-planet systems.

Verdicts
    * stable: strongly AMD-stable with C = 2 C_p (all beta < 1, including the MMR-overlap refinement, and
      beta_S < 1), with every pair inside the domain of Petit et al. (2017);
    * unstable: a two-planet system that is neither AMD-stable nor Hill stable even for exactly coplanar
      orbits (beta_p >= 1 and beta_H,p >= 1). The coplanar values are lower bounds for any inclinations, so
      the equipartition assumption is never used to strengthen a claim of instability;
    * marginal: anything else. AMD instability means only that collisions are not excluded by AMD
      conservation; the Solar System itself is AMD-unstable (Laskar & Petit 2017).
