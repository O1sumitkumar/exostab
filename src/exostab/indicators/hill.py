"""Hill-spacing indicator.

Two planets
    Gladman (1993) applied the Hill-stability criterion of Marchal & Bozis (1982) for the general
    three-body problem to two planets: if it holds, the planets can never have a close encounter. For
    initially circular orbits and small masses it reduces to a separation of 2*sqrt(3) mutual Hill
    radii. We evaluate the eccentric form as restated by Veras & Armitage (2004, their Eqs. 2.5 and
    2.8, without the next-order mass term) and Giuppone et al. (2013, Eq. 3), see :func:`gladman_margin`.
    Petit, Laskar & Boué (2018, Eq. 26) showed that the same inequality can be written with the AMD;
    ``tests/test_hill.py`` checks that the two forms agree. For two planets this is a rigorous
    sufficient condition for the absence of close encounters. It does not exclude the escape of the
    outer planet.

Three or more planets
    No analytic criterion exists. Chambers, Wetherill & Boss (1996) found that the time to the first
    close encounter grows roughly exponentially with the spacing measured in mutual Hill radii. We use
    the spacing of each adjacent pair as a heuristic: any pair that fails the two-planet criterion or
    has crossing orbits is flagged unstable; the system is called stable only if every adjacent pair is
    as widely spaced as Pu & Wu (2015) find necessary for its eccentricities; anything in between is
    marginal. For 7-planet systems of 3 to 9 Earth masses around a solar-mass star, Pu & Wu find that
    half survive 1 Gyr if K_eff >= K_50 = 10.2 on circular, coplanar orbits (their Eq. 12, extrapolated
    from 10 Myr), and that eccentricities raise the requirement (measured at 1 Myr):
    "K_50(sigma_e, sigma_inc) ~ K_50(0, 0) + (sigma_e / 0.01) + (sigma_inc / 0.04)" (their Eq. 14;
    "an eccentricity dispersion of a mere one percent requires the spacing to expand by one Hill
    sphere"), or, in units of the Hill eccentricity e_H = R_H / a = ((m_j + m_k) / (3 M_*))^(1/3),
    "K_50(sigma_e, sigma_inc) ~ K_50(0, 0) + 2.4 [(sigma_e / e_H) + (sigma_inc / (4.0 e_H))]" (their
    Eq. 15 as corrected in the erratum, Pu & Wu 2016). exostab requires, for every adjacent pair,

        Delta >= max(DELTA_MULTI, K_50(0, 0) + 2.4 max(e_j, e_k) / e_H),   DELTA_MULTI = 12,

    using the larger eccentricity of the pair in place of the Rayleigh dispersion sigma_e (conservative)
    and the coplanar orbits exostab models (sigma_inc = 0). DELTA_MULTI = 12 is Pu & Wu's value for
    sigma_e ~ 0.02 and is kept as a floor. Pu & Wu drew each eccentricity from a Rayleigh distribution
    with dispersion sigma_e <= 0.05, so single eccentricities somewhat above 0.05 were common in their
    sample (61% of them for sigma_e = 0.05). As a conservative choice, exostab compares every planet's
    eccentricity with that largest simulated dispersion, ``E_CALIBRATED`` = 0.05, and never calls a system
    stable by this indicator if any eccentricity exceeds it (DECISIONS.md, D12).

The mutual Hill radius of planets j and k is ((m_j + m_k) / (3 M_*))^(1/3) (a_j + a_k) / 2, the
convention of Chambers et al. (1996) and Pu & Wu (2015). In these units the circular-orbit Gladman
limit evaluated here is 2*sqrt(3) up to terms of order (m / M_*)^(2/3): 3.463 for two Earth-mass
planets and 3.429 for two Jupiter-mass planets around a solar-mass star. Lower values quoted
elsewhere, such as 3.39 for Earth masses (Obertas et al. 2017, Eq. 5), come from the lowest-order
criterion normalised to a_1, whose reference semi-major axis differs at order (m / M_*)^(1/3). Keeping
the next-order Marchal-Bozis mass term of Veras & Armitage (2004, Eq. 2.5), omitted here, would lower
the limit slightly (to 3.441 for Earth masses); omitting it is the conservative choice (DECISIONS.md,
D12).
