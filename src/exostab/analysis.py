    * unstable: the direct N-body integration is unstable (close encounters or escapes in the nominal run
      and in at least 95% of the draws), and that evidence rests neither on upper limits, nor on the nominal
      run alone, nor on a single-star model of a system with several stars;
    * inconclusive: the N-body integration could not be trusted;
    * stable: every indicator says stable (including SPOCK when it is enabled), no N-body draw had a close
      encounter or escape, and Monte Carlo draws were run;
    * marginal: everything else, i.e. whenever the indicators disagree or any of them is marginal.

    ``upper_limits`` lists the inputs that are only published upper limits (:func:`upper_limit_inputs`). The
    nominal run uses each limit and the draws are uniform below it, which does not sample a measurement
    uncertainty. A limit on a planet's mass or eccentricity is the worst case for stability, so a stable
    result still holds; an N-body instability, however, only constrains the limited values and gives
    "marginal", whichever input is limited (a stellar-mass limit is not a worst case). Without
    Monte Carlo draws (``--draws 0``) nothing was tested against the uncertainties, so the verdict is at most
    "marginal". ``n_stars`` is the number of stars in the system (the archive's ``sy_snum``); only the host star
    is modelled, so with more than one an N-body instability may come from the model and also gives "marginal":
    the planets may orbit different stars (Kepler-132 b and c, whose periods differ by 4%, cannot stably orbit
    one star), or a companion may change their orbits. The summary is built from the draw counts and never
    claims more than they show.
