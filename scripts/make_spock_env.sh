#
# SPOCK 2.1.1 needs REBOUND < 5, so it cannot share exostab's environment (DECISIONS.md, D23). SPOCK and the
# packages around it (rebound, reboundx, celmech, xgboost, scikit-learn, safetensors) are pinned to the
# combination tested on 2026-09-28 (macOS arm64, Python 3.12). Their own dependencies (torch, numpy, scipy,
# pandas, ...) are not pinned, so a later run can install newer releases of those. celmech and reboundx are built
# from source, so a C compiler is needed (Xcode command-line tools on macOS, gcc on Linux). On Linux, torch is
# taken from the CPU-only index to avoid about 3 GB of CUDA libraries. On macOS no libomp install is needed: the
# exostab worker uses the copy bundled with scikit-learn. Requires uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
#
# Running the script again rebuilds the environment from scratch, for example after a failed build. A target
# folder that exists but is not a virtual environment is left alone and the script stops.
